# docker-stunnel
stunnel dockerfile for GSuite LDAP Connectivity

## Usage

This container runs an unaltered stunnel instance. You will
need to provide your own configuration file through a docker
volume. The same goes for any keys you may need.

To connect to GSuite LDAP, your `stunnel.conf` would look
something like this:

```
setuid = stunnel
setgid = stunnel

foreground = yes

[ldap]
client = yes
accept = 1636
connect = ldap.google.com:636
cert = /etc/stunnel/Google.crt
key = /etc/stunnel/Google.key
```

Your volume for `stunnel.conf` will be something like `./stunnel.conf:/etc/stunnel.conf:ro`.

This particular conf file also requires you to bring in
the certificates generated by GSuite:
  - `./google.crt:/etc/stunnel/Google.crt:ro`
  - `./google.key:/etc/stunnel/Google.key:ro`
